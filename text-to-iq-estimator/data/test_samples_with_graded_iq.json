    {
      "iq": 60,
      "topic": "Why the Sun rises and sets",
      "text": "The sun goes up in the morning and goes down at night. It makes light when it is up and dark when it is gone. It happens every day. The sun moves in the sky, and that is why we have day and night."
    },
    {
      "iq": 80,
      "topic": "Why the Sun rises and sets",
      "text": "The sun rises each morning and sets when the day ends. It gives us light during the day and darkness after it goes down. This happens because the Earth turns, making it look like the sun moves across the sky every single day."
    },
    {
      "iq": 100,
      "topic": "Why the Sun rises and sets",
      "text": "The sun appears to move across the sky because Earth rotates on its axis. When our part of Earth faces the sun, it becomes day; when it turns away, it becomes night. This daily rotation makes the sun seem to rise in the east and set in the west."
    },
    {
      "iq": 120,
      "topic": "Why the Sun rises and sets",
      "text": "The apparent motion of the sun across the sky is a consequence of Earth's axial rotation. As the planet spins eastward, regions gradually enter and leave the sun's illumination, producing alternating cycles of day and night and creating the illusion of a rising and setting sun."
    },
    {
      "iq": 140,
      "topic": "Why the Sun rises and sets",
      "text": "The diurnal progression of solar ascent and descent constitutes a perceptual artifact arising from Earth's eastward axial rotation within an inertial celestial framework. The observer's rotating reference system transforms a static solar perspective into the cyclical alternation of luminous exposure and shadow, perceived as sunrise and sunset."

    {
      "iq": 60,
      "topic": "Why it rains",
      "text": "Rain comes from clouds in the sky. When clouds get heavy with water, the water falls down. It makes the ground wet and fills rivers. Rain helps plants grow. After rain, the sun comes back, and the ground starts to dry again."
    },
    {
      "iq": 80,
      "topic": "Why it rains",
      "text": "Rain happens when clouds fill up with tiny drops of water. When they get too full, the water falls to the ground. The rain soaks the soil and gives water to plants and animals. After the rain stops, the sun shines again and things dry up."
    },
    {
      "iq": 100,
      "topic": "Why it rains",
      "text": "Rain forms when water vapor in the air cools and condenses into droplets that gather in clouds. When those droplets become too heavy, gravity pulls them down as rain. This process provides fresh water for plants, animals, and people, keeping Earth's ecosystems alive and balanced."
    },
    {
      "iq": 120,
      "topic": "Why it rains",
      "text": "Precipitation occurs when atmospheric moisture condenses into droplets within clouds, which coalesce and eventually fall under gravitational force. This hydrological process replenishes freshwater sources, nourishes vegetation, and sustains ecosystems, serving as a critical component of Earth's water cycle and maintaining environmental equilibrium."
    },
    {
      "iq": 140,
      "topic": "Why it rains",
      "text": "Rainfall represents the terminal phase of atmospheric condensation, wherein supersaturated vapor aggregates into liquid microstructures that overcome buoyant resistance. Governed by thermodynamic and gravitational interactions, this mechanism perpetuates the hydrological cycle—redistributing terrestrial moisture, sustaining biotic systems, and preserving the planet's climatological homeostasis."
    },
    {
      "iq": 60,
      "topic": "Why people dream",
      "text": "When people sleep, they see pictures in their heads. The pictures can be nice or scary. Dreams come and go at night. Sometimes people remember them, sometimes they don't. It just happens when we sleep, and no one can stop it or choose the dream."
    },
    {
      "iq": 80,
      "topic": "Why people dream",
      "text": "When we sleep, our minds make stories called dreams. They can be about things we know, want, or fear. Dreams happen while the brain is still working during rest. Sometimes they feel real, and we remember them, but other times they fade away when we wake up."
    },
    {
      "iq": 100,
      "topic": "Why people dream",
      "text": "Dreams occur when the brain remains active during sleep, creating experiences that often reflect our thoughts, emotions, and memories. They can be realistic or strange, pleasant or frightening. Although scientists study them closely, dreams remain one of the most mysterious aspects of how the human mind works."
    },
    {
      "iq": 120,
      "topic": "Why people dream",
      "text": "Dreaming arises from neural activity that continues during the REM stage of sleep, when the brain synthesizes emotions, memories, and subconscious material into symbolic narratives. These internal simulations may aid emotional processing, learning, or creativity, reflecting both the brain's complexity and its ongoing dialogue between reason and imagination."
    },
    {
      "iq": 140,
      "topic": "Why people dream",
      "text": "Dreams emerge from dynamic neurocognitive integrations occurring during rapid-eye-movement sleep, wherein the brain's limbic and associative networks generate hallucinatory narratives that reconcile affective residues with mnemonic constructs. This psychophysiological phenomenon exemplifies consciousness in its most abstract form—an involuntary synthesis of emotion, memory, and symbolic cognition."
