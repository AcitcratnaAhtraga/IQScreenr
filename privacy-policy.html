  <h1>Privacy Policy for IQScreenr</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> IQScreenr does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. All processing happens locally in your browser. We don't track you, we don't store your data, and we don't send anything to any servers.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>IQScreenr does not collect any user data.</strong></p>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personally identifiable information (name, email, address, etc.)</li>
    <li>Health information</li>
    <li>Financial or payment information</li>
    <li>Authentication information</li>
    <li>Personal communications</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Web browsing history</li>
    <li>User activity data</li>
    <li>Tweet content or text</li>
    <li>Twitter/X account information</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How IQScreenr Works</h2>
  <p>IQScreenr is a <strong>100% client-side browser extension</strong>. This means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All analysis happens locally in your browser</li>
    <li>No data is sent to any external servers</li>
    <li>No network requests are made (except for loading the extension itself)</li>
    <li>All processing occurs on your device</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
  <p>IQScreenr uses Chrome's local storage API to store the following data <strong>only on your device</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Display settings, IQ range preferences, filter settings</li>
    <li><strong>Cache:</strong> Cached IQ scores for performance (stored locally, never transmitted)</li>
    <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> IqGuessr game scores and history (stored locally)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is stored locally in your browser and is never transmitted to any external servers or third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
  <p>IQScreenr requires the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save your preferences and cache locally</li>
    <li><strong>ActiveTab:</strong> To access Twitter/X pages and analyze tweets</li>
    <li><strong>Host Permissions (twitter.com/x.com):</strong> To inject content scripts that analyze tweets and display badges</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These permissions are necessary for the extension to function. No data collected through these permissions is transmitted outside your browser.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>IQScreenr does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or data collection services. We do not integrate with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Analytics</li>
    <li>Facebook Pixel</li>
    <li>Any advertising networks</li>
    <li>Any data brokers</li>
    <li>Any external APIs for data collection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.</strong></p>
  <p>Since we don't collect any data, there is nothing to share. All data stored locally remains on your device.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>IQScreenr does not knowingly collect information from children. Since we don't collect any data, this is not applicable, but we want to be clear: IQScreenr is designed to be privacy-safe for users of all ages.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since we don't collect data, changes to this policy will primarily reflect clarifications or updates to our practices.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since IQScreenr doesn't collect any data, there's no data to access, modify, or delete. However, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear all local storage data using the "Clear Cache" button in the extension settings</li>
    <li>Uninstall the extension at any time, which will remove all locally stored data</li>
  </ul>
