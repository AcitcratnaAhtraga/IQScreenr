## Privacy Policy URL

**Required:** You must provide a privacy policy URL.

**Option 1: Host on your website (Recommended)**
```
https://iqscreenr.win/privacy-policy.html
```

**Option 2: Use GitHub Pages or similar**
If you host your website elsewhere, use that URL + `/privacy-policy.html`

**Option 3: Create a simple page**
I've created a privacy policy HTML file for you at:
- `/home/soundboost/Documents/Projects/IQScreenr/privacy-policy.html`

**To use it:**
1. Upload `privacy-policy.html` to your website (iqscreenr.win)
2. Make sure it's accessible at: `https://iqscreenr.win/privacy-policy.html`
